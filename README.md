# Description of files

The create_pbp_database.py file allows the user to easily create a database of the Euroleague 2017-2018 season play by play database locally. The database created by this file is in its rawest format so any analysis can be done on top of it.

The adjust_pbp_and_create_lineups.py file cleans up and also adds lineups to the original data.

# Data folder
In the data folder you can find the raw Euroleague play by play data in case you just want to donwload that directly. You can also find the adjusted (cleaning and lineup additions) data in the same folder under adjusted.

# How to use

Run the create_pbp_database.py file in a suitable directory. This will create all sub folders needed within that directory. If you need to adjust the files as well run the adjust_pbp_and_lineups.py file in the same directory and the adjustments will be made.

# Further work

If you do any work on top of this code and adjust the data from the raw form to something more useful, push the new py file to the repo and explain what kind of a format you are offering.
