#### The database is in its rawest format so any analysis can be done on top of it.

#### In the data folder you can find all the Euroleague play by play data in case you just want to donwload that directly.

# How to use

#### Clone the repo locally in a suitable directory and run the create_pbp_database.py file file. This run will create all sub folders needed within that directory.

# Further work

#### If you do any work on top of this code and adjust the data from the raw form to something more useful, push the new py file to the repo and explain what kind of a format you are offering.
